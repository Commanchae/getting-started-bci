# Getting Started with Brain-Computer Interfaces
## Preface
I'm a university student who's interested in the field of brain-computer interfaces. I was motivated to write this repository to serve as my Wiki or documentation that I can refer to for my learnings and understandings. As such, the content may not be fully accurate, but I will aim to put citations or sources for information!

As of now, I think the best way to break down the topics is the following. (The organization will change as I learn more)

## What are Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)?
### Definition of BCI
### Applications of BCIs

## Understanding of Brain Signals as Data (BSaD)
### Considerations for BSaD
#### Noise
#### Artifacts
### Processing Techniques

## How I Got Started
